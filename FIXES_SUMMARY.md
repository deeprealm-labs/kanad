# Canvas Height Fix - CRITICAL

## 🐛 The Problem

**Console showed:**
```
❌ Canvas has invalid dimensions: 992.65625 x 0
```

**Height was 0 pixels!** This is why the 3D visualization appeared blank.

## ✅ The Fix

### File: web/src/components/molecule/MoleculeReview.tsx

**Before (BROKEN):**
```tsx
<div className="flex-1 min-h-0">
  <Molecule3DViewer
    molecule={moleculeData}
    height="100%"  // ❌ Doesn't work with flex layout!
    showControls={true}
    onAtomClick={handleAtomClick}
  />
</div>
```

**After (FIXED):**
```tsx
<div className="flex-1 min-h-0 h-full">
  <Molecule3DViewer
    molecule={moleculeData}
    height="500px"  // ✅ Fixed pixel height!
    showControls={true}
    onAtomClick={handleAtomClick}
  />
</div>
```

## Why This Happened

1. Parent div has flex-1 and min-h-0
2. Child viewer has height="100%"
3. Problem: 100% of 0 = 0! Flexbox doesn't give explicit height
4. Solution: Use fixed pixel height

## All Fixes Applied Today

### Fix 1: Infinite Loop ✅
- Removed error from loadMolecule dependencies
- File: Molecule3DViewer.tsx:313

### Fix 2: XYZ Data Not Passed ✅
- Changed undefined to xyzData in createMoleculeData
- File: MoleculeCreator.tsx:208

### Fix 3: Canvas Height = 0 ✅
- Changed height="100%" to height="500px"
- Added h-full to parent div
- File: MoleculeReview.tsx:113

## Test Now!

Refresh the page and you should see:
- ✅ Canvas dimensions: ~992 x 500 (not 0!)
- ✅ Molecule visible in 3D
- ✅ Can rotate and interact

Console should show:
✓ Canvas resized and rendered: 992 x 500
✓ Molecule rendered successfully

No more ❌ Canvas has invalid dimensions!

All issues fixed! 🎉
