# Browser Console Debugging for Analysis Display Issue

## Issue Summary
Backend logs confirm that analysis data **IS** being generated and stored in the database:
```
🔍 SQD result keys: dict_keys([...analysis...])
🔍 Has analysis: True
🔍 Analysis keys: dict_keys(['energy_components', 'bonding', 'properties'])
✅ Added analysis to results_dict
```

Database query confirms analysis exists:
```sql
SELECT json_extract(results, '$.analysis') FROM experiments WHERE id='4f095310-2185-43f2-a5a5-d9887db7c8e1'
-- Returns complete analysis with energy_components, bonding, properties
```

But the frontend is NOT displaying it.

## What to Check in Browser Console

### 1. Open Browser Developer Tools
- Chrome/Edge: F12 or Cmd+Option+I (Mac)
- Firefox: F12 or Cmd+Option+K (Mac)
- Go to "Console" tab

### 2. Run a New Experiment
- Submit a new SQD or EXCITED_STATES experiment
- Wait for it to complete

### 3. Look for These Log Messages

#### When experiment completes, you should see:
```
📊 Received results: {energies: Array(3), eigenvectors: Array(3), ...}
📊 Has analysis in results? true  <-- This should be TRUE
📊 Analysis keys: ["energy_components", "bonding", "properties"]
```

**If you see `false` instead of `true`, the problem is data transmission (API or database)**

**If you see `true`, continue checking:**

#### Next, you should see:
```
AnalysisResults received results: {energies: Array(3), eigenvectors: Array(3), analysis: {...}}
Has analysis? true  <-- This should be TRUE
Analysis keys: ["energy_components", "bonding", "properties"]
Energy components: {nuclear_repulsion: 0.758, one_electron: -2.558, ...}
Bonding: {bond_type: {...}, bond_orders: {...}}
Properties: {dipole_moment: 4.09e-15, ...}
```

**If you DON'T see these AnalysisResults logs, the component isn't rendering**

#### Debug info in UI:
You should also see a debug line in the Analysis section:
```
Analysis Sections: Energy(✓), Bonding(✓), Properties(✓)
```

**If you see Energy(✗), Bonding(✗), Properties(✗), the data structure is malformed**

## Expected Flow
1. Backend generates analysis ✅ (confirmed in backend logs)
2. Backend stores in database ✅ (confirmed by SQL query)
3. API returns analysis in `/experiments/{id}` response ❓ (needs verification)
4. Frontend polling/WebSocket receives data ❓ (check console logs)
5. AnalysisResults component receives props ❓ (check console logs)
6. AnalysisResults renders sections ❓ (check UI)

## Possible Issues

### Issue A: Data Not Sent by API
**Symptoms**: Console shows `📊 Has analysis in results? false`
**Fix**: Check API endpoint implementation in `/api/routes/experiments.py`

### Issue B: Data Lost in Transmission
**Symptoms**: Console shows analysis in one log but not the next
**Fix**: Check data serialization/deserialization in API client

### Issue C: Component Not Rendering
**Symptoms**: No `AnalysisResults received results` log
**Fix**: Check condition `status === "completed" && results` in ExperimentMonitor.tsx:607

### Issue D: Data Structure Mismatch
**Symptoms**: AnalysisResults logs show data but UI shows "No analysis data available"
**Fix**: Check if results.analysis exists or if it's nested differently

### Issue E: Component Receives Null/Undefined
**Symptoms**: AnalysisResults logs show `Has analysis? false`
**Fix**: Check if results prop is being passed correctly

## Iteration Counter Issue

### Also Fixed
The "Current Iteration: 9" bug (showing stale data from previous experiment) has been fixed by:

1. **State Reset on Experiment Change** (line 65-89):
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     setCurrentIteration(0);  // Reset to 0 when experimentId changes
     // ... reset other state
   }, [experimentId]);
   ```

2. **Correct Final Iteration Count** (line 236-249):
   ```typescript
   if (exp.status === "completed") {
     // Set iteration count based on actual convergence data from results
     if (exp.results.convergence_history) {
       setCurrentIteration(exp.results.convergence_history.length);
     }
   }
   ```

## Next Steps
1. Run a new experiment
2. Check browser console for the log messages above
3. Report back which logs appear and which don't
4. This will pinpoint exactly where the data flow breaks
